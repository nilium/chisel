TODO
----
  * Add POST form parsing. This is sort of stubbed out right now and
    should be supported.

  * Add locking around sqlite transactions so that write operations can
    be considered vaguely safe.

  * Support for insert queries that return the inserted row ID from
    SQLite and MySQL. Not required for Postgres or Cockroach because
    they allow selecting last inserted ID as part of an insert.

    Both MySQL and SQLite may be able to work around this right now by
    setting an isolation level to get a transaction, assuming that
    selecting the last inserted ID works with multiple transactions (in
    MySQL's case -- in SQLite's case, there can only be one).

  * Better support for accessing previous-query results without the need
    for full `expr` arguments.
    
  * Consider replacing YAML and JSON with codf, which would allow the
    use of multi-line raw strings.
